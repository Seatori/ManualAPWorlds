# Kirby Triple Deluxe (Manual)

## What is a Manual game?
A Manual game is a game where you manually mark locations checked, and you manually restrict what items you use based on
the items you've been sent.

## Where is the options page?
The player options page for this game is located [here](../player-options).
It contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
The locations of the Grand Sun Stones are randomized, and each one gives access to the next Level once collected.
There are also EX Stage Key items that need to be found in order to gain access to each Level's EX Stage.
Additionally, there are options for access to Kirby's Copy Abilities to be randomized, along with Sun Stones that are
needed to fight the bosses, and the ability to access the Copy Ability Testing Room.
The locations of stages and bosses can also be randomized.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
- Grand Sun Stones
- EX Stage Keys
- Sun Stones
- Copy Abilities
- Lose Ability Traps
- Keychains
- Rare Keychains
- Copy Ability Testing Room access

## Where can items be placed in Kirby Triple Deluxe?
Items can always be placed where the 100 Sun Stones and 5 Grand Sun Stones are normally located, and an additional item
is obtained after defeating Masked Dedede's Revenge.
There are also options for items to be found by collecting Keychains, completing Goal Games, and winning rounds of Kirby
Fighters with each available Copy Ability.

## What is the goal when randomized?
As always, the goal is to defeat Queen Sectonia and undo the effects of the Dreamstalk!
There are also options to prevent Queen Sectonia from being fought until a certain number of bosses have been defeated
first.

## How do I install the mod?
You don't. There is no mod.
The tasks of marking locations as checked and limiting your items used based on items received are all performed by you
(the player) while using the Manual client and its accompanying tracker.
